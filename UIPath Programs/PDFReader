BOOK FLAP
Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl is among the most enduring documents of the
twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been read by tens of millions
of people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the
indestructable nature of the human spirit.
Restore in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that had been omitted from the
original edition. These passages, which constitute 30 percent more material, reinforce
the fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless
symbol. She fretted about, and tried to copie with, her own emerging sexuality. Like
many young girls, she often found herself in disagreement with her mother. And like
any teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a child and the full-fledged
sorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable, and more vital than
ever.
Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation, hid in the back of
an Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when the family went into
the Secret Annex, and in these pages she grows to be a young woman and a wise
observer of human nature as well. With unusual insight, she reveals the relations
between eight people living under extraordinary conditions, facing hunger, the
ever-present threat of discovery and death, complete estrangement from the outside
world, and above all, the boredom, the petty misunderstandings, and the frustrations of
living under such unbearable strain, in such confined quarters.
A timely story rediscovered by each new generation, The Diary of a Young Girl stands
without peer. For both young readers and adults it continues to bring to life this
young woman, who for a time survived the worst horror of the modern world had seen
-- and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal.
For those who know and love Anne Frank, The Definitive Edition is a chance to
discover her anew. For readers who have not yet encountered her, this is the edition
to cherish.
